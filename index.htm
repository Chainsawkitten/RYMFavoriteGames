                        <p>A variant of instant-runoff voting where each user's first place vote is counted. Games with the lowest amount of votes are then discarded, and all votes for them are discarded (so if a user voted for it as their 1st game, their vote now becomes their 2nd game). The final score is how many turns it took to discard the game.</p>
